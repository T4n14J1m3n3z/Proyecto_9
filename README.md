## Customer Churn Prediction for Beta Bank

Project Description:

Beta Bank is experiencing a gradual loss of customers each month. The bank has discovered that retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Your task is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have access to historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations.

Objectives:

Develop a model to predict customer churn with the highest possible F1 score. The minimum required F1 score for approval is 0.59. Evaluate the F1 score on the test set.
Measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 score.
